      "text": "A SupaMoto NFT owner has the right to continuously claim the carbon emission reductions produced by a household using a SupaMoto smart cookstove.
      The household receives a cookstove device at no cost and only pays for renewable biomass pellets.
      This saves households up to 50% on their monthly cooking energy expenditure, compared to purchasing polluting fuels such as charcoal.
      
      When carbon emission reductions are verified CARBON credit tokens get generated to your account.
      The CARBON balance in your account can be used to offset your own footprint, shared with others, or swapped for digital cash.
      
      Climate Impacts and Socio-economic benefits
      Clean cooking provides environmental, economic and societal benefits. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates environmental degradation.
      Emerging economy households save on fuel costs and this improves their financial stability. Clean cooking can improve health by reducing indoor air pollution and the risks of fires, particularly for women and children who are most exposed to toxic smoke inhalation. 
      Clean cooking has the potential to empower women and promote gender equality by improving their health, reducing their workload, and increasing their financial independence and decision-making power.
      Scaling access to clean cooking in communities stimulates the local economy by creating new job opportunities in the promotion, distribution, and maintenance of clean cookstoves.
