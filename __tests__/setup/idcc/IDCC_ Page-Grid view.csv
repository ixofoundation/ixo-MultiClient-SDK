And one of the biggest reasons is evening school students have only 3 school hours a day to study the high school syllabus. Right after lessons are over, the school will be shut down (it is 10pm anyway), meaning there is never extra education (or counselling) support for students. They could not pursue for high education and most of them have low income. There is little chance for upward mobility.\n\nStudents have lack of self-study place\nWhile home is not always an option, students in Hong Kong are in fact having a hard time finding just a quiet place with a desk for self-studying. And even they do find one, study might not be efficient because there are never teachers providing on-site support. It is particularly unfavourable for minorities like evening secondary school / some private candidates, who already have poor study channel plus they could not afford any private tutoring session.\n\nStudents have lack of individual private tutoring place\nMany students are known to have extra private tutoring sessions arranged off-school, finding a suitable place for this activity is once again difficult. While public area like fast food and coffee shops are never good choices, home without parents might give the group too much privacy which could put students’ safety at risk (sexual abuse for example).\n\nEducators’ “survival”\nMeanwhile surplus teachers and private tutors are struggling to stay in the industry. Many of them are under-employed or even unemployed because they generally only use word-of-mouth strategy that their customer bases are always small. Those who works in private tutor schools suffer from up to 60% commission of students’ tuition fees taken away that tutors’ income are very low.

Research shows that 47%\nof store disposed food is leftover bread, and retail chains like Yamazaki, Maxims and A-1 bakery throw the leftover bread after their closing time everyday. \n\nAt the same time, the alcohol consumption per capita in Hong Kong was estimated to be 2.64 litres in 2010 (1.21litres of beer, with the largest market for beer). 2015 Beer Price Index compiled by the travel search site, GoEuro, shows that Hong Kong is the second most expensive city for beer, and the average Hongkonger spends US$296 a year on beer. Breweries now find it difficult to manage the high costs of production, namely constituent of the rising raw material cost. Hong\nKong is not only running out of landfill capacity (which is expected to be exhausted by 2020), but growing, malting and transporting barley uses chemicals and fuel for energy, which releases greenhouse gases, while bread left to rot in landfill emits methane. By collecting the unbought bread from bakeries across Hong Kong and supplying it to breweries to use in the\nbrewing of beer, we will be able to replace around a third of the malted barley and many other ingredients like yeast and rye which are currently used for beer production.\n\nOn the other hand, we see another problem, when it comes to ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, with 45% of ethnic minorities with a post-secondary education struggling to find a job. This,\ncoupled with 48% of disabled people being unemployed creates a huge problem for a certain sector of the population, who aren’t able to support themselves in the ever-growing lifestyle of Hong Kong."",""image"":""https://cellnode-pandora.ixo.world/public/oaw1tnvx74fkkqomyuo""},{""title"":""Impact Goal 影響力創造的目標"",""content"":""Our goal is to introduce a vertically integrated food upcycling initiative that promotes the concept of a circular economy, which is the foundation of sustainable living in the days to come.
