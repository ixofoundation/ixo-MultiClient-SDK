## Usage

### RPC Clients

```js
import { ixo, createQueryClient } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";

const { createRPCQueryClient } = ixo.ClientFactory;
const client = await createRPCQueryClient({ rpcEndpoint: RPC_ENDPOINT });

// now you can query the cosmos modules
const balance = await client.cosmos.bank.v1beta1.allBalances({
  address: "ixo1addresshere",
});

// you can also query the ixo modules
const balances = await client.ixo.exchange.v1beta1.exchangeBalances();

We added a custom queryCleint that includes the cosmos modules and ixo modules as well as custom queries

const queryClient = await createQueryClient(RPC_ENDPOINT);

// now you can query any module
const balance = await client.cosmos.bank.v1beta1.allBalances({
  address: "ixo1addresshere",
});


```

### Composing Messages

Import the `ixo` object from `ixo`.

```js
import { ixo } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";

const { createSpotLimitOrder, createSpotMarketOrder, deposit } =
  ixo.exchange.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

Because of the current structure of ixo's blockchain, we had to modify the telescope generation of ts files, thus the above example wont work. For the ixo namespace
please define message using the types from the namespace itself and not from the MessageComposer, eg:

```js
import { ixo } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";

const message = {
  typeUrl: "/ixo.iid.v1beta1.MsgCreateIidDocument",
  value: ixo.iid.v1beta1.MsgCreateIidDocument.fromPartial({
    id: did,
    verifications: [
      ixo.iid.v1beta1.Verification.fromPartial({
        relationships: ["authentication"],
        method: ixo.iid.v1beta1.VerificationMethod.fromPartial({
          id: did,
          type: "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
          publicKeyMultibase: "F" + toHex(pubkey),
          controller: controller,
        }),
      }),
    ],
    signer: address,
    controllers: [did],
  }),
};
```

Please have a look at the tests folder to see examples of all the messages and how to format!

#### IBC Messages

```js
import { ibc } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";

const { transfer } = ibc.applications.transfer.v1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

#### Cosmos Messages

````js
import { cosmos } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";

const { multiSend, send } = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;


## Connecting with Wallets and Signing Messages

‚ö°Ô∏è For web interfaces, we recommend using [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit). Continue below to see how to manually construct signers and clients.

Here are the docs on [creating signers](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/tree/main/packages/react#signing-clients) in cosmos-kit that can be used with Keplr and other wallets.

### Initializing the Stargate Client

Use `getSigningixoClient` to get your `SigningStargateClient`, with the proto/amino messages full-loaded. No need to manually add amino types, just require and initialize the client:

```js
import { getSigningixoClient } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";

const stargateClient = await getSigningixoClient({
  rpcEndpoint,
  signer, // OfflineSigner
});
````

### Creating Signers

To broadcast messages, you can create signers with a variety of options:

- [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/tree/main/packages/react#signing-clients) (recommended)
- [keplr](https://docs.keplr.app/api/cosmjs.html)
- [cosmjs](https://gist.github.com/webmaster128/8444d42a7eceeda2544c8a59fbd7e1d9)

We added a custom Stargate Signing Client that can be exported and creatable under createSigningClient, please note it only support Direct Proto signing through the rpc endpoint! It already has all the proto defininitions in the registry for ixo modules.

```js
import { createSigningClient } from "@ixo/impactxclient-sdk";
```

### Amino Signer

Likely you'll want to use the Amino, so unless you need proto, you should use this one:

```js
import { getOfflineSignerAmino as getOfflineSigner } from "cosmjs-utils";
```

### Proto Signer

```js
import { getOfflineSignerProto as getOfflineSigner } from "cosmjs-utils";
```

WARNING: NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE PLAIN-TEXT MNEMONICS. Please take care of your security and use best practices such as AES encryption and/or methods from 12factor applications.

```js
import { chains } from "chain-registry";

const mnemonic =
  "unfold client turtle either pilot stock floor glow toward bullet car science";
const chain = chains.find(({ chain_name }) => chain_name === "ixo");
const signer = await getOfflineSigner({
  mnemonic,
  chain,
});
```

### Broadcasting Messages

Now that you have your `stargateClient`, you can broadcast messages:

```js
const { send } = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;

const msg = send({
  amount: [
    {
      denom: "coin",
      amount: "1000",
    },
  ],
  toAddress: address,
  fromAddress: address,
});

const fee: StdFee = {
  amount: [
    {
      denom: "coin",
      amount: "864",
    },
  ],
  gas: "86364",
};
const response = await stargateClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [msg], fee);
```

## Advanced Usage

If you want to create a stargate client, please use the function createClient that is exported from package as it will create a stargate client for you with all the needed
registries included and ed key signing capabilities, please note taht only direct signing is supported and not amino signing, so pass in a OfflineDirectSigner when createing client.

If you want to manually construct a stargate client

```js
import { OfflineSigner, GeneratedType, Registry } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing";
import { AminoTypes, SigningStargateClient } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

import {
    cosmosAminoConverters,
    cosmosProtoRegistry,
    cosmwasmAminoConverters,
    cosmwasmProtoRegistry,
    ibcProtoRegistry,
    ibcAminoConverters,
    ixoAminoConverters,
    ixoProtoRegistry
} from 'ixo';

const signer: OfflineSigner = /* create your signer (see above)  */
const rpcEndpint = 'https://rpc.cosmos.directory/ixo'; // or another URL

const protoRegistry: ReadonlyArray<[string, GeneratedType]> = [
    ...cosmosProtoRegistry,
    ...cosmwasmProtoRegistry,
    ...ibcProtoRegistry,
    ...ixoProtoRegistry
];

const aminoConverters = {
    ...cosmosAminoConverters,
    ...cosmwasmAminoConverters,
    ...ibcAminoConverters,
    ...ixoAminoConverters
};

const registry = new Registry(protoRegistry);
const aminoTypes = new AminoTypes(aminoConverters);

const stargateClient = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(rpcEndpoint, signer, {
    registry,
    aminoTypes
});
```

## Developing

When first cloning the repo:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

### Codegen

Contract schemas live in `./contracts`, and protos in `./proto`. Look inside of `scripts/codegen.js` and configure the settings for bundling your SDK and contracts into `ixo-multiclient-sdk`:

```
yarn codegen
```

### Publishing

Build the types and then publish:

```
yarn build:ts
yarn publish
```
